## Prior to Week 8
I decided to start keeping a personal contribution log in week 8 so I could track my work. That is not to suggest that there was no work prior to week 8, it was just that I was not logging as I went.

the following is a summary of my contribution prior to this.
* I have taken the lead role generally lead our group sessions.  This was not my intention however after inital discussion the group chose my idea for our project so I ended up assuming a project/product lead role.
* I researched the tools that would be able to help us build our system, specifically i identified twilio and IBM watson as being suitable for our needs.
* Intial evaluation of twilio was lead by others in the group however this related to the sms capabilites which was not related to the system we where trying to build.  Because of this we almost discouted using twilio.
* I was not comfortable about this and the work to create a messaging system would be large not novel. So I took it apond my self to evalutate twilio and found that it provided a complete chat sdk with guidelines for building a system in python.
* I then verified its usefulness by deploying there sample app to google app engine and got agrement from the group that we should make use of it.
* I giot agreement from that group that we would meet on a weekly basis from about week 2 for a two hour session.
* I created a trello project board for us to track work and gave a brief training session on how Agile sprints are run, We agreed on a 1 weekly cycle with the two hour meeting acting as a sprint demo/reflection/planning meeting.
* have given considerable support to a number of the team members who where strugling to progress with there tasks.
* present and got agreement for a suggested way we could break the work down so that we on the main could work inderpendently while we evaluated tools that we would use to build the system, such as React, Google for authentication, IBM Watson for sentiment analysis, flask python framework, twilio messaging engine, google datastore.
* I then lead the conversation on user stories for our minimal viable productand populated the trello with them all.

## Week 8
* although we had derisked a signifcant amount of the project by indervdually investigating each of the technologies we planned to use in seperate sandboxs we had not yet created our first production ssytem that we could all contribute to and build our app on.  We we're lacking a home page.
* so in I proposed that we set aside a whole day to work together in a mini hackathon to kick start the project and make sure we where all on the same page.
* I got agreement to this and made proposals to what prep work we would need to do to make it worth while.
* I personally took on trying to create a mock api for our user data, contact lists, add contact, add child contact etc.
* I also agreed to look into project folder structure as another team member had difficulties.
